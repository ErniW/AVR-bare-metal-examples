## Blink after pressing a button.
This code waits 5 seconds after the button was pressed to toggle the LED.

*It can help to solve "debouncing button" issue.*

*Now Atomic can be used to make sure that there won't be any interrupt between assigning starting time and time variables so we are sure they're equal.*
